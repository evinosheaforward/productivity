# TF-IDF Procedure

The TF-IDF procedure trains the data to use a TF-IDF function. This function is 
used to find how relevant certain words are to a document, by 
combining the term frequency (TF), i.e how frequent the term is in the document,
with the inverse document frequency (IDF), i.e how frequent a term
appears in a reference corpus.

To apply TF-IDF weighting to a corpus, this procedure needs to be run to produce
the document frequency dataset. The term weighting can then be applied by 
loading it with the ![](%%doclink tfidf function).

## Configuration
![](%%config procedure tfidf.train)

## Input and Output Values

In the input dataset of the procedure, each row is a document and each column is a term, with the value being something other than 0 if the term appears in
the document. This can be prepared using the tokenize function or any other method.

In the output dataset, a single row is added, with the columns being each term present in the corpus, and the value being the number of documents the term appears in.
